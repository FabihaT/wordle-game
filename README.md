Welcome to Wordle, an engaging and challenging word-guessing game! Players have five chances to uncover a hidden five-letter word by guessing different combinations, receiving feedback after each attempt.

How it Works:

Gameplay: The game presents players with a 5x5 grid of empty squares. Players input their guesses by typing letters in each row. The game continues until players successfully guess the entire word or exhaust a set number of attempts.

Features: Instructions: The game instructions are accessible by clicking the "i" button. Dynamic Board: The game adapts to each player's guesses, providing real-time feedback and maintaining an immersive experience. Hints: Need some assistance? The game offers a handy hint feature with the "?" to provide additional clues about the hidden word. Dark Mode: Customize your gaming experience with a dark mode option, given by the "Dark-Light mode" button.

Wordle is developed using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game leverages event listeners to capture player input and dynamically update the game board. The inclusion of asynchronous behaviors simulates the interaction with APIs, creating a responsive and engaging gaming environment.
